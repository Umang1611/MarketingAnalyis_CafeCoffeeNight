# MarketingAnalyis_CafeCoffeeNight
The owner of the restaurant wants you to use this data to come up with a set of recommendations that can help his Café Chain increase his revenues. 
He has not been able to launch a loyalty program and is unable to provide  a data set that has customer level information. 
But, he is able to provide  a data set for POS (point of sale data) for one of his chains.
